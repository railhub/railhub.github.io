Hello world!

I decided to write a blog, about random stuff that I find on the big Internet, or whatever comes to my mind. 
I work as a Software developer, my first language is not English, and I was never good at writing in school. I know, sounds very promising. 
I also tend to start doing some project but never finish it. Lets see about this blog. Several times I started developing Android applications, or website, never to finish it at the end.
Why am I writing you may wonder? I have no idea.
